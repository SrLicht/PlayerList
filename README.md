# PlayerList
A simple command to run through [DiscordIntegration](https://github.com/Exiled-Team/DiscordIntegration) that will give you a list of players without &lt;color> and simpler. Fully customizable. Please stop using `request_data player_list`

### ❓What does it do?❓ 
It gives you a list of players in the game, with time of the round, you can choose to use discord code block, or a simple message. I recommend using the code block is a bit more orderly, but it is subjective.
